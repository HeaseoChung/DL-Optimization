# Tensorrtx 
Build a .pth model using TensorRT network definition APIs to architect the model directly for TensorRT. As a result, most of the models can be built, even though PyTorch or ONNX doesn't support unique operators. The idea comes from [Official tensorrtx](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx/tree/0f944b89750c2cd2e6be7933f84d61eb4e34ec83) and this repo used the idea to create other TensorRT models where are not existed in the official repo.
